# Intro to Streamlit and working with VScode.

## Key points on VScode

#### IDE instead of Regular Notebooks

* Most projects work with .py files 
* All .py files need to be opened in VScode/Pycharm(IDE)
* Preferred IDE: VScode - lightweight
* While it is lightweight it lacks tools to edit python code
* First time VScode users need to install necessary extensions - Python, Pylance and Jupyter. Learn more [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/introvideos/extend)

#### How to open your project folder using vs code 

Use shortcuts

#### Choose which python we want to work with

Please note this works only after you have opened your .py file and have the necessary extensions installed

###### After we choose the python, we now check whether all libraries we need are available

###### If they are not available, we have to install them using the terminal(command prompt)
